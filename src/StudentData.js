    aboutDescription: `"Hello World". I am a Front-End Developer with Full-Stack exposure and 6 years of experience in various IT-related fields, from client support to data analytics and server-side automation. I am passionate about coding and teaching, but especially, I love to be part of a student's development path; there is nothing like seeing and guiding them from their first "Hello world" app to a fully interactive and functional real-world application. These days you can find me busy developing automation solutions for server-side applications. In my spare time, I love to enjoy my beautiful family, play some video games or board games with them, and play some soccer on the weekends.`,
